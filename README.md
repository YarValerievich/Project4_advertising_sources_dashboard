## Purpose: 

It is necessary to analyze player behavior depending on the source of transition.

## Description: 

Data preprocessing has been conducted. Player behavior was analyzed depending on the source of transition.

Users who completed the level by building an orbital station erect the most structures.

The priority channels for investment in advertising are youtube_channel_reklama, yandex_direct, instagram_new_adverts, and facebook_ads.

## Result:

According to the obtained data, the following conclusions can be made:

The most expensive acquisition channel is facebook_ads, with a cost of 13.23 euros per user. It is followed by instagram_new_adverts - 11.66 euros and yandex_direct - 7.32, while youtube_channel_reklama turned out to be the cheapest acquisition channel with a cost of 6.97 euros.

The priority channels for investment in advertising are youtube_channel_reklama, yandex_direct, instagram_new_adverts, and facebook_ads.

The hypotheses have been tested:

- The completion time of the level differs depending on the method of passing;
- The number of structures varies depending on the user's development strategy.

It is recommended to pay attention to youtube_channel_reklama and a possible redistribution of resources for advertising.
